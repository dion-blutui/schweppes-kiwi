description: Blutui project guidelines from the Blutui Engineering team. Use this skill whenever working on ANY Blutui project — writing or editing templates, layouts, components, or partials; creating or querying Collections; building or handling forms; configuring routing or Courier; working with Canopy or Cassettes; using the Blutui MCP; or setting up a new Blutui project from scratch. If the user mentions Blutui, Canopy, Cassettes, Courier, or any Blutui-specific concept, always load and follow this skill before writing any code or configuration.

# Blutui Project Guidelines

Load the rule files that match your task. Always load ALL that apply — multiple rules often overlap.

## Core Rules (Always Apply)

1. **Templates are the HTML shell; layouts are page types editors choose.** Templates (`views/templates/`) define the outer structure that wraps every page — developers own them, editors never touch them. Layouts (`views/layouts/`) extend templates and represent individual page designs that editors pick when creating pages in the dashboard. See `rules/foundation-templates-and-layouts.md`.
2. **Use Canvas for all templating logic.** See `rules/templating-canvas.md`.
3. **Store structured content in Collections**, not hardcoded in templates. See `rules/collections.md`.
4. **Never build raw HTML forms** — use Blutui's form tags. See `rules/forms.md`.
5. **Don't invent new top-level directories.** See `rules/foundation-file-structure.md`.
6. **Search documentation first.** Use `search_blutui_documentation` via Blutui MCP before making code changes. See `rules/mcp.md`.
